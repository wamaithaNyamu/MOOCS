# In aggregation, the lifetime of the owned object does not depend on the lifetime of the owner.
#Letâ€™s take the example of people and their country of origin. Each person is associated with a country, but the country can exist without that person:
class Country:
    def __init__(self, name=None, population=0):
        self.name = name
        self.population = population

    def printDetails(self):

        print("Country Population", self.population)


class Person:

# deletes the object p
del p

c.printDetails()

# COMPOSITION
# Composition is the practice of accessing other class objects in your class. In such a scenario, the class which creates the object of the other class is known as the owner and is responsible for the lifetime of that object.

#    In composition, the lifetime of the owned object depends on the lifetime of the owner.
